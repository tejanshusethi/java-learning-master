Here's a summary of how JDK, JVM, JRE, and JIT work in the context of the provided Java code:

## JDK:

Compiles the Java source code into Java bytecode using the javac compiler.
Creates a .class file containing the Java bytecode.

## JRE:

Runs the Java program using the JVM.
Provides the JVM, Java standard library, and other supporting files.

## JVM:

Interprets the Java bytecode and executes it on the underlying machine.
Manages memory allocation and deallocation.
Provides security features and dynamically loads Java classes as needed.


## JIT:

Compiles frequently executed code into native machine code at runtime.
Provides a performance boost by compiling the kaprekar method into native machine code.


In summary, the JDK compiles the Java code, the JRE runs the program using the JVM, the JVM interprets and executes the bytecode, and the JIT compiler optimizes the performance of the kaprekar method.
